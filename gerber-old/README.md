This is the gerbers for the prototype I used in the video.

A lot of stuff here got revised. Most notably,

* Pullups on the tandy lines that weren't needed were removed.

* 2n3904 transistor and its base resistor were not needed (wired base->collector in the prototype)

* Fuse footprint was too small for the PTC fuse I used
